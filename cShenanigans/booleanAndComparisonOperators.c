//Boolean is a data type that can store only two values; true and false
//However, to create boolean we must #include <stdbool.h> file
//in C, boolean values are represented as int data type and we therefore print with %d and true is represented by 1 and false represented by 0
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdbool.h>
